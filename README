The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create, manipulate,
read, and write Zip archive files.

Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip files.
Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or strings.

Members can be added, removed, extracted, replaced, rearranged, and
enumerated.  They can also be renamed or have their dates, comments, or
other attributes queried or modified.  Their data can be compressed or
uncompressed as needed.  Members can be created from members in existing
Zip files, or from existing directories, files, or strings.

This module uses the Compress::Zlib library to read and write the
compressed streams inside the files.

Examples and helper libraries are given to show how:
  * zip files can be written to strings
  * zip files can be written in chunks to arbitrary functions

Documentation will be installed as man pages for:
	Archive::Zip
	Archive::Zip::FAQ
	Archive::Zip::Tree
	Archive::Zip::MemberRead
